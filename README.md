## A Crisis Management Workshop for Network and Security Incidents
When network and security incidents occur, traditional linear thinking often falls short. Systems thinking provides a powerful framework for understanding the interconnected nature of modern IT infrastructure and responding effectively to crises.

### Why Systems Thinking for Network Engineering?

Network engineering and systems thinking are naturally aligned‚Äîboth focus on understanding complex, interconnected systems. In crisis situations, this approach becomes critical:

**üîç Holistic Understanding**: See the entire system and how components interact, rather than isolated parts

**üîÑ Feedback Loop Recognition**: Identify how network changes cascade through the system, affecting performance and reliability

**üë• Multi-Stakeholder Perspective**: Balance the needs of end-users, administrators, security teams, and business stakeholders

**‚ö° Adaptive Response**: Build resilient systems that can adapt to unexpected events and changing conditions

Systems thinking transforms how we approach network incidents‚Äîfrom reactive troubleshooting to proactive, holistic crisis management.
